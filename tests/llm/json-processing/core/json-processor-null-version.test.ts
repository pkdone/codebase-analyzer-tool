  "namespace": "com.sun.j2ee.blueprints.creditcard.ejb.CreditCardLocal",
  "purpose": "This interface defines the local business contract for a Credit Card Enterprise JavaBean (EJB). Its purpose is to provide a strongly-typed, in-process access point for other components running within the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and EJB container. It specifies the methods available for interacting with a credit card entity, such as retrieving and updating its number, type, and expiration date. By extending javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, it signals to the EJB container that it is part of the local client view for an EJB, allowing for more performant access compared to a remote interface by avoiding network serialization overhead.",
  "implementation": "As an interface, CreditCardLocal does not contain any implementation logic itself; it only declares method signatures. It is intended to be implemented by an EJB class, likely an Entity Bean (given the J2EE blueprint context), which would provide the concrete logic. The interface extends javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject, a standard EJB marker interface that provides local clients with methods to manage the bean's identity and lifecycle. The declared methods are primarily simple accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) for credit card attributes. The getData() method follows the Data Transfer Object (DTO) or Value Object pattern, enabling a client to retrieve all of the credit card's state in a single call, which is an optimization to reduce method invocation overhead.",
