LLM Common Code Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/common/llm` contains cross-project reusable code for managing and routing to LLM models, including non-functional behaviours such as retries, error handling, and re-routing. Make some recommendations for improvements to this code to improve clarity, consistency, and reuse. The LLM code must not be overly complicated and must be easy and intuitive for consumers to use. Identify any ways, parts, or structures in the code that are over-complex or confusing. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that should be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.

Do NOT inlude any of the following topics in your recommendations:

 * The density/complexity of the core JSON processing engine
