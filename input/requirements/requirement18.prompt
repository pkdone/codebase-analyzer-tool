New Features: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The project analyzes a legacy application, reporting as many important details as possible to help new users understand its structure, size, and nuances. However, the project could be significantly improved in terms of the types and depth of details it captures. Identify at least 5 NEW informative aspects of legacy applications that the project could capture and report on, to provide users with additional insights into how the application works and is constructed. Ensure that you are not recommending any insights that are already being collected and reproted on in the application. The features should be net new features not already catered for by the application. Consider that the legacy application will be around 10-40 years old, and the user wants to analyze the application to understand the potential complications that will be faced when they try to modernize it from an ancient technology stack (which they may understand little about) to a modern technology stack. For each new aspect, provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that would be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.

Note, I would like one feature to be around showing Current Architecture in a new tab which uses mermaid style diagram to show the main software "business" components internal and inherent to the application code (e.g., "Loan Manager", "Customer Manager", "Order Taker"), which might not be obvious but which can be inferred from all the code. Also, show the external dependency "components" that the main internal software business compontents rely on, but with a different colour for these "external components". There is no need to use the LLM go collect more summary information about the code to help infer software "business components". The information in the source code summary of the code files (e.g., "java", "csharp", "ruby", "python") can be used, specifically using the "purpose" and "implementation" sub-fields already captured.
