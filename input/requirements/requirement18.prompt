New Features: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The project is used to analyse a legacy application and report as many important details as possible about the legacy application. However, the project could be significantly improved in terms of the types of details it captures. Identify at least 5 new aspects of legacy applications that the project could capture and report on, providing users with additional insights into the application. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that would be altered and/or added to the instructions on what changes/additions to make. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
