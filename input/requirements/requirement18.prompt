New Features: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The project is used to analyse a legacy application and report as many important details as possible about the legacy application to allow new users to understand the structure, size and nuances of the application. However, the project could be significantly improved in terms of the types and depth of details it captures. Identify at least 5 new informative aspects of legacy applications that the project could capture and report on, to provide users with additional insights into how the applicaiton works and is constructed. For each new aspect, provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that would be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
