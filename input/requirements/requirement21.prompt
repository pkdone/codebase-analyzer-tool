LLM Prompting Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folders `src/app/prompts` (for app specific code) and `src/common/prompts` (for cross-project reusable code) contain code to related to managing prompts, templates and other metadata used to make requests to LLMs and process their responses. I like having the folder `src/app/prompts` centrally and separate from the `src/app/schemas` and `src/app/repositories` folders, because even though the models/schemas in these 3 folders are related they provide a good level of indirection to shield the changes of one from another. Regarding the code in `src/app/prompts` and src/common/prompts`, plus any other code that is related to it, make some recommendations for improvements to this code to improve clarity, consistency, and reuse, plus address any redundant/superfluous/duplicate code that can be refactored. The prompting code must be easy and intuitive to use by conusumers of the code. Also, consider if AppSummaries related prompt code (e.g. for instruction and fragments) should be similarly structured for both or structured differently to reflect that their use cases and usage patterns may be different. Identify the ways in which the prompt templating and processing code should be improved in this way and provide references to the specific part(s) of that code that should be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Also, ensure no resulting generated text for the prompts is alterered as a result of these changes, unless you have a compelling reason to do so, for which you must ask first.
