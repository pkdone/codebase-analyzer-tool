Prompt Templating Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/prompt-templates` contains code to related to managing prompts and the metadata used to make requests to LLMs and process their responses. I like having this folder centrally and separate from the `src/schemas` and `src/repositories` folders, because even though the models/schemas in these 3 folders are related they provide a good level of indirection to shield the changes of one from another. Regarding the code in `src/prompt-templates` and any other code that is related to it (e.g., `src/llm/utils/prompt-templator.ts`), make some recommendations for improvements to this code to improve clarity, cleanliness, consistency, reuse and modularity. Identify the ways in which the prompt templating and processing code should be improved and provide references to the specific part(s) of that code that should be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third party JSON repair library.
