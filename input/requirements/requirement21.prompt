Log LLM JSON Response Mutated: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The LLM Router functionailty logs various LLM states. I want a new type of stat to be logged which is when the JSON processing logic needed to mutate the LLM's response to coerce it to be parsed into JSON. However I don't want this to be logged if the response only had to be trimmed and/or have markdown codeblock ticks removed at the start and end of the trimmed LLM response. Analyse the codebase and come up with a plan to implement this requirement. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
