New Feature: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Come up with a plan for a new feature which requires adding a new seciton to the generated HTML report which shows the top-level Java classes in the project (Java classes which are not depended on by any other classes in the project). I've already create a new method called `getProjectTopLevelJavaClasses()` in the Sources repository class and interface to be used. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs to change to accomodate this new featue. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
