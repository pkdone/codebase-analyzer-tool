Fix Structure Of Tests To Match Main Codebase Structure Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. I've restructured the sub-folders for the main applicaiton code, hanging off `src` and now the sub-folders for the tests, hanging off `tests`, need to be re-structured to mirror the structure of the main application code, where appropriate. Come up with a plan of the changes to make to the structure of the test folders to achieve this. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
