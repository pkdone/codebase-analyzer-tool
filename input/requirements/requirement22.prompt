JSON Sanitizer/Transform Schema Aware Denoting: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/llm/json-processing` contains code to process JSON-like text returned by LLMs, ensuring it can be parsed into JSON and, if required, validated against a schema. In particular, the folder `src/llm/json-processing` contains `sanitizers` and `transforms` sub-folders with many functions to fix specific types of text that purport to be JSON but contain faults that prevent parsing into JSON. Some of the sanitizer/transform code is generic and works against any problematic JSON-like text, where other code is JSON schema aware and looking for JSON text relating to a specific schema. The `sanitizers` folder and `transforms` folder should each have two sub-folders, "generic" and "schema-specific" each containing the appropriate source files for that sub-folder type. If a specific "santizer" or "transform" file contains a mix of both generic and schema-specific code, split the file into two, one for each, before moving. All the resulting code and structure should still pass all the existing tests (the tests may need minor modificaiton to ensure they are using any changed file paths and class/method/function names.) Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third-party JSON repair library,
