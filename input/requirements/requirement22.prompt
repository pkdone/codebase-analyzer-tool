JSON Sanitizer/Transform Fixing Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/common/llm/json-processing` contains code to process JSON-like text returned by LLMs, ensuring it can be parsed into JSON and, if required, validated against a schema. In particular, the folder `src/common/llm/json-processing` contains `sanitizers` and `transforms` sub-folders with many functions to fix specific types of text that purport to be JSON but contain faults that prevent parsing into JSON. The pipelines of different sanitizer/transform functions look for pieces of hardcoded text and consequently may be too specific and could be made more generic and inherently catch more fault variants that you can anticipate (e.g. use regular expressions for a range of possible characters rather than trying many different variations of hardcoded characters). Identify how the code of the JSON sanitizers/tranforms could be improved for catching as many variations of the JSON text error types being looked for, or anticipated, as possible, whilst still supporting fixing all the types of "bad JSON text" that was supported before and still passing all the unit tests for such "bad JSON text" (even though you may need to tweak the unit tests to work against the refactored set of sanitizers/transforms). Ideally, the logic in these sanitizers and transforms should not be aware of the specific JSON schema used, so in you analysis including lookin for opportunities for the code to be more schema-agnostic in the patterns it looks for to fix. Ensure that all existing JSON text error cases are still supported in the code and there are no regressions which loses some of the JSON text error fixes that are already in place. Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third-party JSON repair library,
