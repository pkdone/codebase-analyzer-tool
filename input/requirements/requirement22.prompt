JSON Transform Schema Reduction: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/llm/json-processing/transforms/schema-specific` contains code to process JSON-like text returned by LLMs, hardcoded to assume a specific JSON schema to enforce and correct. However, LLM responses could be returned which have any abitrary schema. Therefore try to identify ways in which some of this code can be made generic, and non-schema-specific and hence moved to the `generic` folder. The intention is to have the least code as possible, specific to a particlar schema. Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third-party JSON repair library,
