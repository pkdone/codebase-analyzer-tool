JSON Sanitizer Fixing Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/llm/json-processing` contains code to process JSON-like text returned by LLMs, ensuring it can be parsed into JSON and, if required, validated against a schema. In particular, the folder `src/llm/json-processing/sanitizers` contains many functions to fix specific types of text that purport to be JSON but contain faults that prevent parsing into JSON. The pipeline of different sanitizer functions has grown quite large. Some sanitizers are similar to others and should be consolidated into a more generic single sanitizer. Also, some sanitizers look for pieces of hardcoded text and consequently may be too specific and could be made more generic (e.g. use regular expressions for a range of possible characters rather than trying many different variations of hardcoded characters). Identify how the code of the JSON sanitizers could be improved, and especially reduced in the amount of sanitizers, by some becoming more generic where possible, whilst still supporting fixing all the types of "bad JSON text" that was supported before and still passing all the unit tests for such "bad JSON text" (even though you may need to tweak the unit tests to work against the refactored set of sanitizers). Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third-party JSON repair library,
