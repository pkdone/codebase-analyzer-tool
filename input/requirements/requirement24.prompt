JSON Parsing/Validating Improvements: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/llm/json-processing/core` contains code to process JSON-like text returned by LLMs, ensuring it can be parsed into JSON and, if required, validated. At the moment, all the parsing work is done in the `json-processor.ts` file at the end of which it calls code in the `json-validator.ts` file to perform validation. The code is also too verbose. Instead there should be 3 concise TS files, one for json-parsing, one for json-validating and a the higher level json-processing file which calls the parsing one and then the validating one, with appropriate error handling. Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third-party JSON repair library. All existing integration and unit tests should still work without requiring modification, unless they require cosmetic changes to use new file paths and functions due to the changes, or the affected tests were just testing comsmetics aspects only regarding the old code structure.
