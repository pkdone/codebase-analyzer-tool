Make LLM Code Generally Common: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The LLM handling code at `src/common/llm` was recently moved there from `src/app/llm` and is intended to be generic and potenitally useful to multiple projects. Identify if there are any other refactorings that the code `src/common/llm` would benefit from to make the code more streamlined, easier to consume from other projects, if the code was copied over as-is, generally more elegant and consise without losing any behaviour. Don't make any recommendations related to logging or messages, warnings or errors. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
