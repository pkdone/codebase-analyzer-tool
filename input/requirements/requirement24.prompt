Make LLM Code Generally Common: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The LLM handling code at `src/llm` is intended to be generic and potenitally useful to multiple projects. Plan what it would take to move this to a new home in the common folder, eg. a new home at `src/common/llm`. Consider whether the current LLm contains artefacts that are project-specific and need to be left outside the common folder, and what refactorings this would required. Additionally, any unit tests for the LLM code in `tests/llm` will need to be similarly moved. The moved LLM code needs to be able to to be used more standalone from the rest of the project if needed. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
