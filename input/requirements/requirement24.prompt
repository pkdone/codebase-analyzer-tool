Fix stage data aggregators used: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The data-aggregators in `src/components/insights/data-aggregators` should not be part of the insights generation stage which puts data into the `app-summaries` repostiory. Instead, these data-aggregators should be transformed into data-providers in `src/components/reporting/data-providers` used in the later reporting stage, so that this data is pulled dynamically from the 'sources' respository during construction of the report. Consequently, the file 'src/schemas/app-summaries.schema.ts' should not include "billOfMaterials", "codeQualitySummary", "scheduledJobsSummary","moduleCoupling", or "uiTechnologyAnalysis" in the `AppSummaryCategories` schema and should not have schemas defined for them. Come up with a plan to make these changes to have these data aggregations driven from the "reporting" process and not the "insights" process.  Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs improvement with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
