JSON Tools Cleanup: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The folder `src/llm/json-processing` contains code to process JSON-like text returned from LLMs to ensure it can be parsed to JSON and validated with a schema, if requried. The code is quite messy and could do with a clean-up for clarity, cleanliness, better modularity, better error handling, and more consistent logging. Most of the issues that occur in LLM responses seem to be when the JSON contains embedded code. Identify the ways in which the JSON processing code should be improved and provide references to the specific part(s) of that code that should be altered and/or added to, with a plan on how to apply and verify the changes/additions required. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. Do not suggest using a third party JSON repair library,
