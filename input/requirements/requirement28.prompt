New PRD Addition: I will create a new TypeScript application, separate from this project and codebase. The current codebase has a nice patterns I want to replicate in the new application which has separate `src/app/schemas` and `src/app/repositories` and `src/app/prompts` directories because even though the data models/schemas in these 3 folders are related they provide a good level of indirection to shield changes on one from the other. Basically, I am using Zod types to model the domain and to define the interfaces for external integration points, rather than TypeScript types. For example, if the application provided a REST API, it would also have its interfaces defined similarly, based on `src/app/schemas` but overridden in its own folder. I will use AI coding agents to develop the new application, and so I want to include the Product Requirements Description (PRD) for it, with appropriate wording to describe the design pattern I've just detailed here. Produce the appropriate wording for this that I can then insert into my PRD. 

The content of each file in the current application's codebase is shown below as a reference:
