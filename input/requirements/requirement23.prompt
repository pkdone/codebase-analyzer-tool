LLM Response Processing Warnings Consistency: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The application uses different types of logging for warning of problems processing LLM responses. See the output log excerpt below which demonstrates this challenge. I want one consistent styyle of logging these warnings and I'd like a particular warning for this to just take up one line of console text only (using `console.warn()` for all these. If the logged text includes some text that has newllines in it (e.g. a sample of JSON multiline text shown) replace newlines with spaces. Derive an implementation plan for implementing all the changes you identify. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
