Call Chain For JSON Validation Losing Typeing`: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The function `validateJsonWithTransforms()` in `src/llm/json-processing/core/json-validating.ts` returns typed data based on T defined by the caller. However, I suspect the call chain that calls this function, in the application, doesn't type this very strongly and also the returned data's type is lost or cast away afterwards further up the call return chain or gets weakened to just the `LLMGeneratedContent` type. Validate if this is the case and, if so, suggest improvements in this code and the call chain code to provide stronger typing in and out. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. For this analysis, ignore any of the code used for Unit Tests and Integration Tests.
