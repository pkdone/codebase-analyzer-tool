Call Chain For JSON Validation Losing Typing: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The function `validateJsonWithTransforms()` in `src/common/llm/json-processing/core/json-validating.ts` returns typed data defined by the caller. However, I worry that the call chain that calls this function, in the application, doesn't type this very strongly and also the returned data's type is lost or cast away afterwards further up the call return chain or gets significantly weakened at some point. Validate if this is the case and, if so, or if some of the compromises are justified from a pragmatic perspective and where necesary, suggest improvements in this code and the call chain code to provide stronger typing in and out, in the places required, if any (except those places in the code already called out with explicit comments about why the typing is handled a specific way in that part of the code). Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected. For this analysis, ignore any of the code used for Unit Tests and Integration Tests.
