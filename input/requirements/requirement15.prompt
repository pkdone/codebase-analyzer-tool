Wrong Method Visibility: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify any places in the code where class methods are public/protected but should be less visible (protected/private) due to only being used by subclasses or from internally within the same class. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
