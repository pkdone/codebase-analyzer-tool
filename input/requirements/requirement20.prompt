Consts and Static Config Use/Declaration: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application, where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. The codebase defines varuos constants at different levels, in classes that use the consts, in files that use the const, in other config files in the same folder/area as the files that use it, more centrally in a common shared configs folder. Analyse the codebase and determine if all these strategies are optimial and places where the wrong stategy is used and should be changed. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
