Modern JavaScript/TypeScript: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify the top 10 parts of code which aren't fully leveraging the capabilities of the more modern aspects of newer versions of JavaScript up to the 14th Edition of ECMAScript (ECMAScript 2023) and the newer versions of TypeScript (if there is ambiguity, favor TypeScript over JavaScript). Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.

Do NOT inlude any of the following topics in your recommendations:

 * Overly Broad and Confusing Environment Configuration
 * Ambiguous "Task" Layer and Component Placement
 * Monolithic Repository Implementation
 * Redundant Documentation Files (`AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`)
 * Consolidate CLI Entry Points
 * Unclear Separation in `llm/providers` Subdirectories
 * Consolidation of responsity data model with schemas data model
 * Monolithic Schema Definition File
 * Overly Granular Utility Files in `common/utils`
 * Simplify Entry Points with Top-Level `await`
 * Misplaced `DatabaseInitializer` Component  
 * Monolithic Dependency Injection Token File
 * Centralized DI Registration Logic
 * Make DI Token Definitions Cohesive and Modular
