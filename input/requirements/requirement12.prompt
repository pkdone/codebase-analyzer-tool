Bad Names: Act as a senior programmer analyzing the code in a TypeScript application where the content of each file in the application's codebase is shown below in a code block. Identify the top 10 places in the code where folders, files, classes, methods, functions, constants or variables are badly named and imply the wrong behaviour with their current name. If the name of a file or folder doesn't match the purpose of its contentm it should be called out. For each, suggest a more appropriate name. Provide references to the specific part(s) of the code that needs these improvements with suggestions on how to improve. Include the list or relative file paths of each source file affected.
