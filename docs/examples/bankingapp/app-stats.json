  "appDescription": "The Legacy Banking Application is a comprehensive, monolithic enterprise system designed to manage core banking operations. It is built upon a legacy Java EE technology stack, specifically utilizing Java 6/8 compatibility and running on the JBoss 4.2.3.GA application server. The application's architecture is heavily data-centric, relying on an Oracle 21c XE database not just for storage, but for critical business logic execution via PL/SQL stored procedures. The frontend is constructed using Java Server Pages (JSP) which frequently demonstrate the anti-pattern of embedding direct database queries within the presentation layer. The backend logic is distributed across Stateless Session EJBs (Enterprise JavaBeans) and standard Java Servlets, which act as controllers. These components are tightly coupled to the database schema, often invoking stored procedures for operations like account creation, transaction processing, and loan approval. The system handles a wide array of domain entities including Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Loans, and Branch information. Integration capabilities are provided through a SOAP-based web service (BankingService) using JAX-WS. Batch processing is implemented via shell scripts that invoke SQL*Plus to trigger database-side logic for end-of-day reconciliation and interest calculations. The application enforces business rules such as KYC validation and balance checks, often implemented within database triggers or complex SQL queries. Security and auditing are managed through database triggers that populate audit log tables. The system is containerized using Docker, orchestrating the JBoss application server and the Oracle database. This application serves as a prime example of legacy architecture requiring modernization, showcasing tight coupling, logic leakage into the database, and monolithic deployment artifacts."
