  FORCE_JSON_FORMAT: `In your response, only include JSON and do not include any additional text explanations outside the JSON object.
NEVER ever respond with XML. NEVER use Markdown code blocks to wrap the JSON in your response.
ONLY provide an RFC8259 compliant JSON response that strictly follows the provided JSON schema.
CRITICAL JSON FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL property names MUST be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "name": "value", NOT name: "value")
- ALL string values MUST be enclosed in double quotes
- Use proper JSON syntax with commas separating properties
- Do not include any unquoted property names or values
- Ensure all brackets, braces, and quotes are properly matched
- COMPLETE ALL PROPERTY NAMES: Never truncate or abbreviate property names (e.g., use "references" not "eferences", "implementation" not "implemen")
- ENSURE COMPLETE RESPONSES: Always provide complete, valid JSON that can be parsed without errors
- AVOID TRUNCATION: If you reach token limits, prioritize completing the JSON structure over adding more detail
- ESCAPE QUOTES IN STRING VALUES: If you must include double quotes inside a string value (e.g., HTML attributes like type="hidden", code snippets, or quoted text), you MUST escape them with backslashes. For example: "description": "Creates <input type=\\"hidden\\"> element" NOT "description": "Creates <input type="hidden"> element"
- NO STRAY TEXT: Do NOT include any stray words, fragments, characters, or text directly before property names. Each property name must start with a double quote immediately after the preceding delimiter (comma, closing brace/bracket, or newline). This includes single characters (e.g., "e") as well as full words (e.g., "tribal"). Example: ✅ CORRECT: },\n  "property":  ❌ INCORRECT: },\ne"property": or },\nword"property": or },\ntribal"property":
- EXAMPLE: ✅ CORRECT: {"name": "value", "items": [{"id": 1}]}  ❌ INCORRECT: {name: "value", items: [{id: 1}]}
- EXAMPLE FOR QUOTES: ✅ CORRECT: {"implementation": "Uses <input type=\\"hidden\\">"}  ❌ INCORRECT: {"implementation": "Uses <input type="hidden">"}
- EXAMPLE FOR STRAY TEXT: ✅ CORRECT: },\n  "integrationPoints": [  ❌ INCORRECT: },\ne"publicMethods": [ or },\ntribal"integrationPoints": [

STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (extract whenever possible): databaseName (specific database/schema name if mentioned), tablesAccessed (array of table names from queries or DDL), operationType (array: ['READ'], ['WRITE'], ['READ', 'WRITE'], ['DDL'], ['ADMIN']), queryPatterns (e.g., 'CREATE TABLE statements', 'INSERT/UPDATE operations', 'complex joins', 'stored procedures'), transactionHandling (e.g., 'explicit BEGIN/COMMIT', 'auto-commit', 'none'), protocol (database type and version if identifiable, e.g., 'PostgreSQL 14', 'MySQL 8.0', 'SQL Server 2019', 'Oracle 19c'), connectionInfo ('not applicable for SQL files' or specific connection details if present)`,
  },

  XML_SPECIFIC: {
    UI_FRAMEWORK_DETECTION: `UI Frameworks Detection (REQUIRED for web application config files)
If this XML file is a web application configuration file, you MUST analyze and identify the UI framework:
  * Struts Framework Detection:
    - Look for <servlet-class> containing "org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet" or "StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter"
    - Check for <servlet-name> with "action" or "struts"
    - Look for DOCTYPE or root element referencing struts-config
    - Extract version from DTD/XSD if available (e.g., "struts-config_1_3.dtd" => version "1.3")
    - If detected, provide: { name: "Struts", version: "X.X" (if found), configFile: <current file path> }
  * JSF (JavaServer Faces) Framework Detection:
    - Look for <servlet-class> containing "javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet" or "jakarta.faces.webapp.FacesServlet"
    - Check for root element <faces-config> in faces-config.xml
    - Extract version from namespace (e.g., "http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee" with version="2.2")
    - If detected, provide: { name: "JSF", version: "X.X" (if found), configFile: <current file path> }
  *Spring MVC Framework Detection:
    - Look for <servlet-class> containing "org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet"
    - Check for root element containing "http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc"
    - Look for annotations like @Controller, @RequestMapping in servlet definitions
    - If detected, provide: { name: "Spring MVC", version: <if identifiable>, configFile: <current file path> }
If a UI framework is detected, populate the uiFramework field. Otherwise, omit the field entirely from the JSON response.`,
  },

  JSP_SPECIFIC: {
    DATA_INPUT_FIELDS:
      "A list of data input fields it contains (if any). For each field, provide its name (or an approximate name), its type (e.g., 'text', 'hidden', 'password'), and a detailed description of its purpose",
    JSP_METRICS_ANALYSIS: `JSP Metrics Analysis (REQUIRED for all JSP files)
You MUST analyze and provide the following JSP metrics in the jspMetrics object:
  * scriptletCount (REQUIRED): Count the exact number of Java scriptlets (<% ... %>) in this file
  * expressionCount (REQUIRED): Count the exact number of expressions (<%= ... %>) in this file
  * declarationCount (REQUIRED): Count the exact number of declarations (<%! ... %>) in this file
  * customTags (REQUIRED if any exist): For each <%@ taglib ... %> directive, extract:
    - prefix: The tag library prefix from the taglib directive
    - uri: The URI of the tag library from the taglib directive
   Examples:
    - <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %> => { prefix: "c", uri: "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" }
    - <%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" %> => { prefix: "fmt", uri: "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt" }
    - <%@ taglib prefix="custom" uri="/WEB-INF/custom.tld" %> => { prefix: "custom", uri: "/WEB-INF/custom.tld" }
   Note: Do NOT count directive tags (<%@ ... %>) or action tags (<jsp:... />) as scriptlets. Only count code blocks with <% %>, <%= %>, and <%! %>.`,
  },

  SHELL_SCRIPT_SPECIFIC: {
    CRON_EXPRESSIONS:
      "Look for cron expressions in comments like '# Cron: 0 2 * * *' or systemd timer references",
    DATABASE_OPS: "Identify database operations (mysql, psql, mongo commands)",
    EXTERNAL_API_CALLS: "Note any external API calls (curl, wget)",
  },

  BATCH_SCRIPT_SPECIFIC: {
    TASK_SCHEDULER: "Look for Windows Task Scheduler references (schtasks, AT commands)",
    DATABASE_OPS: "Identify database operations (sqlcmd, osql, BCP)",
    NETWORK_OPS: "Note network operations (NET USE, COPY to UNC paths)",
    SERVICE_OPS: "Identify service operations (NET START, SC commands)",
  },

  JCL_SPECIFIC: {
    EXEC_STATEMENTS: "Extract all EXEC statements to identify programs/procedures called",
    DD_STATEMENTS: "Identify DD statements for file I/O",
    COND_PARAMETERS: "Note COND parameters that indicate job dependencies",
    SORT_UTILITIES: "Look for SORT, IEBGENER, or custom program calls",
