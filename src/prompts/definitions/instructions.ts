export const FORCE_JSON_FORMAT = `The response MUST be valid JSON and meet the following critical JSON requirements:
- Only include JSON: start directly with { or [, no XML, markdown, explanations, or other text
- All property names must be quoted: use "propertyName": value at ALL nesting levels (both opening and closing quotes required)
- Property name format: every property must follow the exact pattern "propertyName": value - no unquoted names (e.g., use "name": not name:)
- Property names must be followed by a colon: use "propertyName": value, not "propertyName" value or "propertyName" []
- All string values must be quoted: use "value" not unquoted strings
- No markdown formatting: do not use asterisks (*), bullet points (•), or any markdown characters before property names
- No stray text: do not include any text, characters, or lines between or around JSON properties
- Every property must have a name: do not omit property names (e.g., use "purpose": "value" not ": "value")
- Use proper JSON syntax: commas, colons, matching brackets/braces, and escape quotes in strings
- Complete and valid: ensure all property names are complete (no truncation) and JSON is parseable
- Use only exact property names from the schema - do not add extra properties or characters before property names
- No stray prefixes: do not add prefixes like "ar" or other characters before array elements or string values
- ASCII only: use only ASCII characters in string values
- No explanatory text: do not include phrases like "so many methods" or "I will stop here" in the JSON
- Proper commas: ensure commas separate all array elements and object properties
- Escape control characters: any control characters in string values must be properly escaped as \\uXXXX`;
